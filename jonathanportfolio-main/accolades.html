			<h1> I have achieved many things during my academic years in High School and College.</h1>
			
			<p>In this page, I will list off most of my more memorable academic achievements.</p>
	<p>Throughout most of my highschool career, I was almost always on the high honors list, with some of the best grades of my class.</p>
					
			<p>I graduated from my High-School, Hugh C. Williams High-School, and successfully gained my high-school diploma.</p>
			
			<p>Additionally, I also gained my BOCES certificate in Buisness and Multi-Media design at the same time.</p>
			<p> For two of my years in college in a row, I have had the highest grade point average of my class for my major, for which I have recieved two different awards for.
</p>
			
			<p>I have not always had such a good work ethic. When I was just starting out in high-school I would constantly prorastionate on my work and I would put almost no effort into it. However, this changed during my sophomore year, where I finally wisened up to the fact that my success in high-school and in college would dictate how the rest of my life would turn out. I then successfully turned my entire academic career around, and I now have a 3.91 GPA in my junior year of college.
</p>
			
			<p> By showing my academic achievements, I have shown my future employer that I have had an above average academic career, and the paragraph above shows that I have a great work ethic, and I also have the perserverence to succeed at the position that I am interested in.</p>

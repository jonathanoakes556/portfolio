<h1> I have made many different websites and other coding projects during my time as a student.</h1>
			<p>My first real experience with coding was when I took an introduction to coding class during my sophomore year of high-school. In this class, we used a beginner friendly version of the coding language Python, known as Pyret. Using this coding language, I managed to learn how to make simple animations and games with justthe power of computer code.</p>
		
			<p>During this time, I also signed up to enroll in BOCES Seaway Technical Center in Norwood. This meant that during my Junior on Senior years of High School, I would spend half of my work day in a software development class, which is where I learned most of what I now know about coding websites and backend development.
				<p>Additionally, I have had many years of helping and aiding other children and young adults in learning how to code, acting as somewhat of an assistant teacher for multiple years during my time as a high-schooler. I also have had multiple years of experience as a babysitter for multiple children.</p>
</p>
			
			<p>For instance, this entire website is based off of the website designs that I had created during my time at BOCES.
</p>
			<p>We first started with the simple concepts such as managing spreadsheets and using Notepad to make simple website designs. Later on during my Junior year we spent time working with many different coding languages, some of which include HTML, PHP, MYSQL, CSS, and Javascript.</p>
			
			
			<p>During this time I also grew used to working with the Adobe Creative Cloud. One of my favorite parts of this class was when we finally got acess to photoshop and were told the ins and outs of the program itself. I was much less excited to work with Illustrator, but a college class that I took during my Sophomore year of College helped me apreciate the program a lot more than I had previously.</p>
			<p>Currently, I am now a Junior in SUNY Canton, and I am still managing to learn more and more about the ins and outs of coding. Currently, I am working on getting more skilled at the Java and XML languages, and I hope to take more coding classes in the future.

			<p>One of my biggest accomplishments during my academic career was the creation of the SUNY Canton art diversity display in the campus public library. This display includes seven photo frames that capture key points and visually appealing projects across campus. While the art itself is important, the most valuable experience I’ve gained is how to effectively manage time and how to overcome all setbacks in my way.</p>


<p> Our first major setback was availability of team members and our clients. I am not on campus often as I commute, and one of my team members also commutes. This left us one member who could be consistently on campus. Not only that, contacting all of our clients through email left a bit of communication lag, which made it almost impossible to meet all clients. Nonetheless, I managed to power through and single handedly maintained contact with all parties involved.</p>


<p>Another setback was dealing with my teammates. I am the team leader of the diversity group, and I often struggled with my teammates in the beginning. They wouldn’t communicate effectively, and they did not have any incentive to do critical work. I had to learn to step up and take the reins, and directly tell them what their responsibilities were. I also learned to adapt to criticism and take advice into consideration.</p> <br>
